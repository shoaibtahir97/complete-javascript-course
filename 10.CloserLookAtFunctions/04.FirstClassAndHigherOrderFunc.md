### First Class Function

- Javascript functions are simply values
- Function are just another object.
- Functions can be stored in variables or as object properties.
- Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. E.g a function attached to addEventListener.
- Return functions from functions
- Call methods on functions

### Higher Order Functions

- A function that receives another function as argument, that returns a new function or both.
- This is only possible because of first class functions.
- First class function is a feature of JavaScript, which means that all functions are values.
