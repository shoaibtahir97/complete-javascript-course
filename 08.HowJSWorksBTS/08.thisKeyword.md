# The this keyword

- Special variable created for every execution context(every function), along with variable environment and scope chain.
- Takes the values of the owner of the function in which the this keyword is used.
- this is not static. It depends on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned when the function is actually called.
  - If a variable x = 5; then it will remain 5 in its whole lifecycle. But the this keyword will change based on how the function is called.

## 4 Ways to call a function:

1. <b>Method(function attached to an object)</b>: this => Object that is calling the method.
2. <b>Simple function call</b>:
   - this => undefined in strict mode
   - this => points to global object(window) in normal mode.
3. <b>Arrow functions</b>: this => Arrow functions do not have their own 'this' keyword. If we use 'this' keyword in arrow function it will point to 'this' keyword of its parent function(lexical 'this').
4. <b>Event Listener</b>: this => DOM element that the handler is attached to.

## What 'this' is not:

1. this will not point to the function itself, also not to its variable environment
