# Variable Environment

Execution context consist of

1. Scope Chain
2. Variable environment
3. this keyword

## Hoisting

- Makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared.
  "Variables lifted to the top of their scope."

- Before executed, code is scanned for variable declaration and for each variable a new property is created in variable environment object.

- Hoisting does not work the same for all variable environment and function types.

1. Function Declaration:

- Hoisted: true
- Initial Values: Actual Function
- Scope: Block (strict mode = block scope | function scope )
  We can use Function Declaration before the code is executed, they are saved in Variable Environment Object.

2. Var Variables:

- Hoisted: true
- Initial Values: undefined (Bug)
- Scope: Function

3. Let and Const Variables:

- Hoisted: false (Technically yes, but not in practice)
- Initial Values: uninitialized, they are placed in Temporal Dead Zone(Place between start of code and place where variable is declared)
- Scope: Block

4. Function Expression and Arrow Function:
   Depends if using let/const or var, similar condition

## Temporal Dead Zone for let and const

<code>
const myName = 'Jonas';

if(myName === 'Jonas'){</br>
console.log(`${myName} is a ${job}`);</br>
const age = 2037- 1989;</br>
console.log(age);</br>
const job = 'teacher';</br>
console.log(x)</br>
}
</code>

- If we try to access job variable before it is initialized in the TDZ we will get uninitialized error.But if we try to access a variable that is not defined then we get not defined error.

#### Why TDZ

- To catch errors and differentiate them. Accessing variables before declaration is bad practice and should be avoided
- To make the const variable actually work

#### Why Hoisting

- Using functions before function declaration.
